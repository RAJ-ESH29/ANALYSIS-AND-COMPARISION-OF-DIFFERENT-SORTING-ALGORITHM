# ANALYSIS-AND-COMPARISION-OF-DIFFERENT-SORTING-ALGORITHM
This research paper explains about some famous sorting algorithms like insertion sort, bubble sort, selection sort, heap sort, quick sort and merge sort. This is a mini project done to fulfill the project criteria in data structure and algorithm.
# ABSTRACT
From the beginning of computing, the sorting problem has attracted a great deal of research, perhaps due to the complexity of solving it efficiently despite its simple and familiar statement. Among the authors of early sorting algorithms around 1951 was Betty Holberton, who worked on ENIAC and UNIVAC. Bubble sort was analyzed as early as 1956. Comparison sorting algorithms have a fundamental requirement of O(n log n) comparisons, algorithms not based on comparisons, such as counting sort, can have better performance. Although many consider sorting a solved problem, asymptotically optimal algorithms have been known since the mid-20th century, useful new algorithms are still being invented, with the now widely used Tim sort dating to 2002, and the library sort being first published in 2006. So this attracted us towards this project and we decided to compare some famous sorting algorithms on the basis of their time.
